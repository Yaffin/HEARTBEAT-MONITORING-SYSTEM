Heartbeat Monitoring System using Blynk, NodeMCU ESP8266, and MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter

Overview
This project is a heartbeat and SpO2 monitoring system that uses the MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter sensor, NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller, and the Blynk IoT platform. The system measures heart rate and blood oxygen levels in real-time and displays the data on the Blynk mobile app.

Features
Real-time Monitoring: Continuously measures heart rate and SpO2 levels.
IoT Integration: Sends data to the Blynk app for remote monitoring.
Wireless Connectivity: Uses Wi-Fi through the NodeMCU ESP8266 for seamless data transmission.
User-friendly Interface: Blynk app provides an easy-to-use interface for real-time data visualization.
Components
NodeMCU ESP8266: Microcontroller used for data processing and Wi-Fi communication.
MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter: Sensor used to measure heart rate and blood oxygen levels.
Blynk App: IoT platform to visualize the data in real-time.
Breadboard and Jumper Wires: For connecting the components.
